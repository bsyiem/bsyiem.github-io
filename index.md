# About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with [Prof. Eduardo Velloso](https://www.eduardovelloso.com/) at the University of Sydney. I received my PhD from the University of Melbourne in 2023 (supervised by [Prof. Eduardo Velloso](https://www.eduardovelloso.com/), [A/Prof. Jorge Goncalves](https://www.jorgegoncalves.com/) and [A/Prof. Tilman Dingler](http://tilmanification.com/)). I have previously worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Queensland University of Technology (supervised by [A/Prof. Selen TÃ¼rkay](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/selen.turkay)) and the University of Melbourne (supervised by [Prof. Frank Vetere](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6534-frank-vetere)). My research investigates novel implementations, design and use of eXtended Reality (XR) technologies to enhance individual, social & collaborative experiences.
