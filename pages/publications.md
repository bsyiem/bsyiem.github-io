Scientific sense-making in STEM fields is a complex, yet essential activity, that greatly benefits from collaborations. However, challenges associated with collaboration, such as the geographic separation of experts, access to specialised equipment, and meaningful data representation, often hinder this process. Solutions to collaborative challenges have been extensively explored in CSCW and HCI literature. Among such solutions, immersive systems offer novel data visualisations, interactions, and representations that can support collaborative sense-making in STEM fields. Recognising the increasing interest from HCI researchers on the intersection of collaboration and immersive systems, we conduct a systematic review to answer pertinent questions regarding the research landscape, the design and implementation of collaborative immersive systems for STEM sense-making. We find that current research leans towards synchronous collaborations, AR technology, and sense-making for learning in science domains. We further discuss prevalent trends and considerations observed in our findings, to inform future research directions.

Recent work on augmented reality (AR) has explored the use of adaptive agents to overcome attentional issues that negatively impact task performance. However, despite positive technical evaluations, adaptive agents have shown no significant improvements to user task performance in AR. Furthermore, previous works have primarily evaluated such agents using abstract tasks. In this paper, we develop an agent that observes user behaviour and performs appropriate actions to mitigate attentional issues in a realistic sense-making task in AR. We employ mixed methods to evaluate our agent in a between-subject experiment (N=60) to understand the agent’s effect on user task performance and behaviour. While we find no significant improvements in task performance, our analysis revealed that users’ preferences and trust in the agent affected their receptiveness of the agent’s recommendations. We discuss the pitfalls of autonomous agents and highlight the need to shift from designing better Human–AI interactions to better Human–AI collaborations.
